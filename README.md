# blender-bake-tool
This is a fork of the BakeTool with some improvements that I did to have better workflow. 

99.99% of work was done by BakeTool team. But as there is no public git repository and as it was hard for me to contact the team with my bug-fixes and extra features, I decided to setup this repo.  

I think, that Blender baking workflow, as it is without any add-ons, is the worst, that can be imagined. At least, I can't imagine anything worse. With that limitation, people jump to other software for there texturing needs. And it's a shame as Blender is very capable in this regard.
